We used our first lecture to look at case studies in four main areas: exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and working with network data.

We discussed a few examples, including using aggregate search activity to [predict consumer behavior](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/41/17486.full.pdf), exploring browsing logs to understand how Internet usage [varies across demographic groups](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM12/paper/viewFile/4660/4975), and analyzing the structure of information cascades to understand [how content spreads online](https://5harad.com/papers/twiral.pdf).

During this discussion, we touched on how easy it is to find [spurious correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com), [cheat at prediction](http://hunch.net/?p=22), and [lie with statistics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393310728/).
